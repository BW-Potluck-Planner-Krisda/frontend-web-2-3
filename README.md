# frontend-web-2-3

Project Set up:

DO NOT fork this repo, please

DO: 1. clone the master into your fave code editor

2. cd into folder potluck and run npm install, you should have all your dependencies needed from there

3. npm start to make sure the node modules are working

4. create a branch of your own to add/commit/push up to the repo

We will be merging into the webdev branch and when all conflicts are gone, the webdev will merge into the master

Good luck and have a blast!
